# Description of the game
A tram that moves around a city map and grows
as long as it picks passengers up. 

# Run the project
Download the liver server extension for VS code.
Using live server fire up the index.html file in a port.

# How the game works
- The snake moves automatically upon the start of the game
- The player can control the directions
- The game is over if the tram collides with canvas borders
- Randomly adding people appearing across the map for the tram to pick up which corresponds with the score
- The tram grows longer while it picks people up

# Wining Logic
The more people picked up the longer the tram grows and the harder the game gets.
(the tram will be longer so it will be harder to avoid collisions.)

# Losing Logic
The tram collides with the canvas boundary.
